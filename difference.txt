What are the two types of Intents?
The two types of Intents are
- Explicit Intent - where we clearly target the activity that handles our Intent
- Implicit Intent - where we broadcast a request that any app with the capability can take up

Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?
Explicit Intents are more secure as we have significantly more control over the execution as opposed to Implicit where we never know how our request is going to be handled.

Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
Generally, Implicit Intent is the proper way to do an Intent.

Fixing the incorrect Intent
- I fixed the Intent in the SecondFragment.kt file as it was an Implicit Intent.
- It was calling the /api/index implicitly while there is a way to do so explicitly through ProductScrollingActivity class that renders the api response into an activity.
- I did this by using the same code used in the ThirdFragment.kt file as the target of both Intents was to display the index ProductScrollingActivity.
